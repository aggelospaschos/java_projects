# Java Projects

Welcome to the Java projects repository! Here, you'll find a curated selection of exercises tailored to help you master essential concepts in computer science, particularly focusing on data structures and algorithms.

## What to Expect

This repository offers a hands-on approach to learning key concepts in computer science. Through practical implementations of various data structures and algorithms, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively organize and manipulate data, as well as develop efficient problem-solving skills.

## What's Inside

### Data Structures

In this repository, you'll explore a variety of data structures that form the backbone of computer science:

- **Arrays:** Simple yet powerful for storing collections of elements.
- **HashMap:** A versatile tool for fast storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.
- **Lists:** Dynamic structures that allow for flexible manipulation of data.
- **Stacks:** Handy for managing data in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.
- **Deque:** Offers flexibility with double-ended queue operations.
- **2D Arrays:** Perfect for organizing data in rows and columns, commonly used in grid-based scenarios.

### Algorithms

Algorithms are the heart of problem-solving in computer science. Here's a glimpse of what you'll encounter:

- **Binary Search:** A staple for efficiently finding elements in a sorted array.
- **Grouping and Searching:** Utilizes HashMap for tasks like grouping anagrams and searching for patterns.
- **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):** Cleverly evaluates arithmetic expressions using stack-based logic.
- **Sliding Window Technique:** Employs a smart strategy for finding optimal subarrays.
- **Backtracking:** A powerful tool for solving complex puzzles and optimization problems.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring the exercises and running the code, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   `git clone https://github.com/aggelospaschos/java_projects.git`

2. **Navigate to the Exercise Directory:** Each exercise is contained within its own directory. Move to the directory of the exercise you wish to explore. For example, if you want to delve into the "Anagram Sum" exercise, you would navigate to its directory:

   `cd java_projects/AnagramSum`

3. **Compile the Java Files:** Before running the code, you'll need to compile the Java files. This can be done using the `javac` command. For instance:

   `javac AnagramSum.java`

4. **Run the Program:** Once the Java files are compiled, you can run the program using the `java` command followed by the name of the main class. Since each exercise contains its own main method, you can execute the program directly. For example:

   `java AnagramSum`

5. **Explore and Experiment:** With the program up and running, feel free to explore the functionality provided. Detailed comments within the code will guide you through the process and explain the logic behind each step. Modify the code, test different inputs, and experiment with the concepts to deepen your understanding.

6. **Repeat for Other Exercises:** If you wish to explore other exercises, simply navigate to their respective directories and follow the same steps outlined above.

By following these steps, you'll be able to dive into each exercise, understand its implementation, and gain valuable insights into the underlying data structures and algorithms. Happy exploring!
